                                curious and like to be the center of attention. They are very 
                                friendly and playful. With poor training and a lack of obedience 
                                lessons, Pomeranians can develop aggressive tendencies and excessive 
                                barking problems. A little defensiveness is okay, but don’t let your 
                                Pomeranian become a nuisance for everyone around you. They respond 
                                well to obedience and agility training, so it’s up to you to show

                                and fragile – it won’t stand up to much rough-housing or careless handling. 
                                Generally, Pomeranians are very friendly and well suited to family life.</td>

                                barking and aggressive posturing to a minimum. Toys and positive 
                                reinforcement can help you train your Pomeranian.</td>

                                obedience school in young Pomeranians.</td>

                                when they seem to want to be around you all the time! They seek approval
                                from people around them, but they can become overprotective and 
                                defensive if poorly trained or neglected. Pomeranians exhibit a high
                                level of intelligence and respond well to obedience and agility 
                                training. Your Pomeranian is a curious little dog, so be sure to dog-proof 
                                your home before your new guest arrives. Garbage cans, beware!</td>
