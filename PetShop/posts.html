                    <p>
                        The Golden Retriever is one of the most popular dog <br> 
                        breeds in the United States. The breed’s friendly, tolerant<br>
                        attitude makes them great family pets, and their intelligence <br>
                        makes them highly capable working dogs. Golden Retrievers <br>
                        excel at retrieving game for hunters, tracking, sniffing out <br>
                        contraband for law enforcement, and as therapy and service dogs. <br>
                        They’re also natural athletes and do well in dog sports such <br>
                        as agility and competitive obedience. These dogs are fairly <br>
                        easy to train and get along in just about any home or family. <br>

                    <h2><b><a href="file:///D:/4course_FMI/Front_End_Web/Front_End_Web/PetShop/post2.html"> German Shepherd</a></b></h2>
                    <p>
                        German Shepherd Dogs can stand as high as 26 inches at the <br>
                        shoulder and, when viewed in outline, presents a picture of <br>
                        smooth, graceful curves rather than angles. The natural gait is <br>
                        a free-and-easy trot, but they can turn it up a notch or two and <br>
                        reach great speeds. There are many reasons why German Shepherds <br>
                        stand in the front rank of canine royalty, but experts say their <br>
                        defining attribute is character: loyalty, courage, confidence, the <br>
                        ability to learn commands for many tasks, and the willingness to <br>
                        put their life on the line in defense of loved ones. <br>

                    <p>
                        Descended from large sled dog breeds, the now-tiny <br>
                        Pomeranian has a long and interesting history. The foxy- <br>
                        faced dog, nicknamed “the little dog who thinks he can,” is <br>
                        compact, active, and capable of competing in agility and <br>
                        obedience or simply being a family friend. Even though these <br>
                        are purebred dogs, you may find them in the care of shelters <br>
                        or rescue groups. Remember to adopt! Don’t shop if you want <br>
                        to bring a dog home. Poms may be small, but they don’t <br>
                        always act that way and may even challenge larger dogs. <br>

                        With positive reinforcement, Ragdoll cats learn quickly and <br>
                        can pick up tricks as well as good behaviors such as using <br>

                        to just about everyone. They love their human families–even <br>
                        children–and will get along with other pets fairly well.Docile, <br>
                        sweet, and happy to relax for a good cuddle session, the loving Ragdoll <br>
                        will even greet their humans at the door when they come home. If you’re <br>
